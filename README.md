# YoRPG_DoNotConsumeArsenic: Corina going solo
---
### Character class:
* contains all the characteristics that will be shared by both Monster and Protagonist
  * Such as isAlive(), the lowering of hp points, and attacking enemies

### Monster class:
* in which the instance variables in Character is set in regards to what monster is capable of

#### Monster subclasses:
* Dragon: the most powerful of all, they are strong in defense due to their scales, strength, and have a higher lifespan.
* Troll: they have stronger attack factors but nothing else out of ordinary
* Orc: Due to their awful smell, they are stronger in defense and strength

### Protagonist class:
* Heroes to project unto
* They have a name but otherwise inherit all from Character

#### Protagonist subclasses:
* Healer: they have an interesting ability to replenish HPs but weaker in all else
* Tank: Tough, tough, tough (mostly defense and some strength)
* Warrior: they are fighters (so higher offense, lower defense)

### Version-to-version Modifications:
* v0 is the beginning of all
* v1 contains the beginnings of Character class
* v2 contains the Protagonist and their subclasses
* v3 contains the Monster and their subclasses

#### How to grow game?
* It would be interesting if there are more range of actions.
* Also elixirs and potions and magic spells to come into play?
* More Monster and Protagonist varieties are always fun too.
